In this game a user gets 9 attempts to guess the letter that the computer has chosen at random. If they are able to guess in less than 9 tries, they win the game! If they are unable to guess the computer's letter in 9 tries, they will lose the game. The wins and loses can be tracked by the counters on top of the page.

Be sure to press the dark spot on the moon for a cool soundtrack!

Happy guessing!
